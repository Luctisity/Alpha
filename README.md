# Alpha
Luctisity Alpha on Github. Probably where I'm dropping all the code for the early release of the website.
By the way, I've never used GH, so all sorts of things can happen.

Luctisity Alpha is basically a very early release of the new features on the website, intended for testing. A small group of people can actually contribute to the code (A.K.A. the Luctisity Council). Others can just view what's new.

P.S. Main branch does a fucky-wucky, please refer to the index-file branch
